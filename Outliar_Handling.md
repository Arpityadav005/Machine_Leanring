This project demonstrates how to detect and handle outliers in a dataset using statistical and visualization methods.

## 🔍 Techniques Covered

### 1. **Visualization**
- Histogram with KDE
- Boxplot

### 2. **Outlier Detection**
- IQR (Interquartile Range) Method

### 3. **Outlier Treatments**
- Removing Outliers
- Imputation with Mean
- Capping (5th and 95th Percentile)

## 📦 Libraries Used
